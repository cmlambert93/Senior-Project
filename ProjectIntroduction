        <p>Hello, my name is Christopher Lambert and this is a website I created for
            my senior project at Wilmington University. </p>
        <p>My goal in this project is to look at education levels in the United States from the years 
        2000 â€“ 2024, with a deeper look at the data in Wisconsin, Arkansas, and Delaware. Listed below are the reasons I picked these states.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Wisconsin is where I received the majority of my education, from kindergarten through a semester or two of college.</li>
        <li>Arkansas is where I currently reside and work in. </li>
        <li>Delaware is where Wilmington University is located.</li></ul>
        
        <p>It is my hope that I can take the data that I find, and put it together in visualization graphics, and see if there are any trends throughout 
            the years with various events or programs, such as President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind act and the COVID pandemic. </p>
        
        <p>My final hope is that this project will showcase my data analytic skills and I can utilize this website in future job interviews.
